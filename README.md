# How do I approach desigining software?
When it comes to designing software, I generally approach design from the top level down. When it came to OpenGL I had to alter my design strategy and immediately boil things down to a lower level (individual shapes making up the objects I want to create). I think going through this experience was useful because it helped me to understand that sometimes projects will require a change in approach to successfully complete.

#How do I approach developing programs?
During this OpenGL course I have reinforced a habit I have of constantly testing small changes that are made. During the course of creating and rotating shapes and scaling them, I've had to make minor adjustments and test each and every time to ensure that the shapes line up correctly. This iterative approach helped me create the 3D scene that I wanted to.

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Well, one of my major goals is to continue creating video games. Learning about OpenGL has given me insight into creating graphics directly myself without the need for game engines like unity or unreal. This can be beneficial because not only can those engines often be overkill for small projects, but it allows me to have a more intimate amount of control over the graphics rendering itself.
